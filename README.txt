To link with the Scripts repo, make sure this is folder is located in one of the following two places:

1. In a folder called “Script Libraries” in the user’s “Library” folder (you’ll need to make the “Script Libraries” folder, and the “Library” folder is hidden)

2. In the a “Script Libraries” folder inside the computer’s “Library” folder. Not hidden, but the permissions might be weird.

There are more places where this works, but it’ll take a bit more setup.
