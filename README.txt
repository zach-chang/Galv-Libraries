To link with the Scripts repo, make sure this is folder is located in one of the following two places:

1. In a folder called ~/Library/Script Libraries/Galv-Libraries/ (you’ll need to make the “Script Libraries” folder, and the “Library” folder is hidden)

2. In a folder called "Galv-Libraries" in the “Script Libraries” folder inside the computer’s “Library” folder. Not hidden, but the permissions might be weird.

There are more places where this works, but it’ll take a bit more setup.
